                <p> Sylhet is currently drowning due to heavy floods and many people are left without electricity and
                    resources. Majority of Sylhet has been heavily affected and businesses are facing a huge loss due to
                    their inventory getting destroyed. People are starving because they are unable to get food and their
                    homes are being demolished by the heavy flooding. For many, their businesses are their only source
                    of
                    income and majority of it is completely wiped out. We are raising money to send over to people who
                    can
                    distribute the money to the individuals who need it the most. that time we should help them by
                    donation

                <p> Many areas of Sylhet city have gone under water again because of another round of flooding in a span
                    of one month, with water continuing to rise, leading to fears of prolonged suffering for flood
                    victims.

                    Houses and business organisations in different areas of Sylhet city including Shahjalal Uposhohor,
                    Teroratan, Sobhani Ghat, and Kalighat are submerged, disrupting road communication in the areas.

                    Water has also entered different areas of Sunamganj municipal town. Due to the flooding, many
                    educational institutions have closed in the district. in that time they need help from us to survive
